# Signifier Website

* The static site is generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). To generate the site, `hugo` binary needs to be installed. Run `brew install hugo` if necessary. 
* [hugo-creative-theme](http://themes.gohugo.io/creative/) was chosen as it is designed to host pages rather than a blog site. 
* The generated artifacts under `public` directory is copied to `s3://signifier.jp` bucket and hosted via AWS S3. To deploy, you need to have `$HOME/.aws/credentials`. 
* To develop, run `hugo server -w`, and edit YAML files under `data/project`, and HTMLs under `themes/hugo-creative-theme/layouts/partials` if necessary.
* To publish, run `./publish`.
